###Conclusion

Summing Up

In this presentation, we covered the features and the usage of Configuration management tool - CHEF.

CHEF is an open source Configuration Management tool which is very popular among industries.

Chef is a thin DSL (domain-specific language) built on top of Ruby. This approach allows Chef to provide just enough abstraction to make reasoning about your infrastructure easy. Chef includes a built-in taxonomy of all the basic resources one might configure on a system, plus a defined mechanism to extend that taxonomy using the full power of the Ruby language.

Ruby was chosen because it provides the flexibility to use both the simple built-in taxonomy, as well being able to handle any customization path your organization requires.


Apart from the features listed in the presentation there are many other features in CHEF that together make life easy.

Hope this helps you get started with CHEF.
