#Introduction to CHEF

Chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby and Erlang. It uses a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configuration "recipes".

The user writes "recipes" that describe how Chef manages server applications and utilities (Apache HTTP Server,MySQL etc) and how they are configured. These recipes describe a series of resources that should be in a particular state.

State contains information on packages that should be installed, services that should be running, or files that should be written.
