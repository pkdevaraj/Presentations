###Configuration Management 

Configuration management (CM) is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional and physical attributes with its requirements, design and operational information throughout its life.

CM is the practice of handling changes systematically in an organized way so that a system maintains its integrity over time. This system implements the policies, procedures, techniques, and tools that are required to manage, evaluate proposed changes, track the status of changes and support documentation as the system changes.
