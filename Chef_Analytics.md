# Chef Analytics

- The Chef Analytics platform is a feature of Chef that provides real-time visibility into what is happening on the Chef server, including whatâ€™s changing, who made those changes, and when they occurred. Individuals may be notified of these changes in real-time. Use this visibility to verify compliance against internal controls.
