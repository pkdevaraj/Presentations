##**ECLIPSE IDE**

###**INTRODUCTION**

What is IDE : Integrated Development Environment 
- Tool with features required for software development.
- Eclipse is one such open source IDE used for developing softwares.
- Can be used to develop software in C, C++,java, ABAP, COBOL, Python, Ruby etc.
- Provides an open platform for application development tools run on a wide range of operating systems.
- Can be used in any phase of development like Design, Development, Testing etc.
- Provides features for seamless integration of software modules developed individually.
- First release of the eclipse  project was made in 2001 and has been growing since then.
- Eclipse created by OTI and IBM teams responsible for IDE products
   - IBM VisualAge/Smalltalk (Smalltalk IDE) 
   - IBM VisualAge/Java (Java IDE)
   - IBM VisualAge/Micro Edition (Java IDE)

###**What is Eclipse**
- Eclipse is a universal platform for integrating development tools.

**Plug-in** - smallest unit of Eclipse function
Example – CDT, ObjectAid etc.

**JDT** - Provides the tool plug-ins that implement a Java IDE supporting the development of any Java application.

**Eclipse Platform** - Common base for all development, Includes runtime,frameworks etc

**JVM** - JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE An abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program


###**Eclipse User-Interface**
User Interface of Eclipse can be changed according to the user preferences. This is the typical UI provided.

The position of any forms (views in Eclipse) can be customised according to the user requirements.

##**Why Eclipse**

There are several reasons to use Eclipse. A few of them include:
- Open Source – Free of Cost.
- Supports most of the programming languages with appropriate plugins.
- Single tool that can be used for design, development, testing etc.
- User Friendly (Intuitive User Interface).
- Can be integrated with several Version management (Ex: Perforce etc) and build softwares(Ex: ANT).
- Available on most of the platforms

##**Getting Eclipse**

- Download the latest version from [here](http://www.eclipse.org/).
- You may need to install Java SDK1.6 or JRE if you haven’t from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/downloads/index.html#java).
- After installation the path variable is to be set to the bin folder of java installation.
- Unpack the package and run eclipse.exe in windows or eclipse in Linux.

##**Plugins**

- Eclipse is an extensible platform for building IDEs. It provides a core of services for controlling a set of tools working together to support programming tasks. Tool builders contribute to the Eclipse platform by wrapping their tools in pluggable components, called Eclipse plug-ins.
- A plug-in connects with a universe of other plug-ins to form a running application.
- In short Plug-in is the smallest unit of Eclipse.
- When a plug-in wants to allow other plug-ins to extend or customize portions of its functionality, it will declare an extension point. The extension point declares a contract, typically a combination of XML markup and Java interfaces, that extensions must conform to. Plug-ins that want to connect to that extension point must implement that contract in their extension.
- Extension point is a named entity for collecting “contributions” Example: Extension point for workbench preference User Interface.
- This is specified in the manifest.xml file of every plugin.

###**Typical arrangement in Plugin Architecture**

![alt text](https://github.com/pkdevaraj/Software-Engineering-Presentations/blob/master/images/Img3.png "PluginArchitecture1")

- **Plug-in A**
   - Declares extension point P
   - Declares interface I to go with P
- **Plug-in B**
   - Implements interface I with its own class C
   - Contributes class C to extension point P
- Plug-in A instantiates C and calls its I methods

##**Plugin Installation**

- Plugins are mostly in java and can be installed either directly from the repository using the url or by downloading the package and importing the same.
- To learn how to install the plugin directly from the repository [check this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7t5daTM-T8)

##**Eclipse Runtime**
- The Eclipse runtime defines the plug-ins (org.eclipse.osgi and org.eclipse.core.runtime) on which all other plug-ins depend and is responsible for defining a structure for plug-ins and the implementation details of the same.
- The runtime is also responsible for finding and executing the main Eclipse application and for maintaining a registry of plug-ins, their extensions, and extension points.
- The runtime also provides utilities, such as logging, debug trace options, adapters, a preference store, and a concurrency infrastructure.

##**Eclipse Platform Architecture Detailed Overview**

The JDT project provides the tool plug-ins that implement a Java IDE supporting the development of any Java application, including Eclipse plug-ins.

The Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) provides tools to create, develop, test, debug, build and deploy Eclipse plug-ins, fragments, features, update sites and RCP products.

SWT – Standard Widget Toolkit - Used for generic low level graphics and widget set.

JFace - UI frameworks for common UI tasks
