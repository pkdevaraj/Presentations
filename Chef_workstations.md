##CHEEF WORKSTATION


A workstation is a computer that is configured to run various Chef command-line tools that synchronize with a chef-repo, author cookbooks, interact with the Chef server, interact with nodes, or applications like Chef Delivery.

The workstation is the location from which most users do most of their work, including:

* Developing cookbooks and recipes (and authoring them using Ruby syntax and patterns)
* Keeping the chef-repo synchronized with version source control
* Using command-line tools
* Configuring organizational policy, including defining roles and environments and ensuring that critical data is stored in data bags
* Interacting with nodes, as (or when) required, such as performing a bootstrap operation

While Chef includes tooling like the Chef development kit, encourages integration and unit testing, and defines workflow around cookbook authoring and policy, itâ€™s important to note that you know best about how your infrastructure should be put together. Therefore, Chef makes as few decisions on its own as possible. When a decision must be made, the chef-client uses a reasonable default setting that can be easily changed. While Chef encourages the use of the tooling packaged in the Chef development kit, none of these tools should be seen as a requirement or pre-requisite for being successful using Chef.
